# Finite element Global Digital Image Correlation (2D_FE_Global_DIC)
2D Finite-element-based global DIC method (guarantee global kinematic compatibility and decrease noise by adding regularization penalties).  

Welcome to give the 2D_FE_Global_DIC code ratings and comments in the MATLAB File Exchange community:

## Prerequisites & Installation
2D_FE_Global_DIC MATLAB code was tested on MATLAB versions later than R2018a. Please download and unzip the code to the MATLAB working path. Then, execute the mail file main_FE_Global_DIC.m.

## Code Manual
It is already included in the code. It's also available at my Researchgate: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/345907429_Finite_Element_Global_Digital_Image_Correlation_FE-Global-DIC_Code_Manual_v10

## Code Demo
2D_FE_Global_DIC MATLAB code demo is very similar to the ALDIC code:
